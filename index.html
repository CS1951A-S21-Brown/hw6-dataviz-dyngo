        <div class="col-lg-4">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col text-align-left">
                    <ul>
                        1. Graph 1 (top left on full screen) shows the top 10 ranking videogames, and their corresponding Global 
                        Sales. It aims to display the top 10 videogames of all time, and I believe that the ranking (accumulation 
                        of all sales) is a good indication of how well the game did overall. Graph 2 was interactive with three different buttons,
                        that corresponding to the three different regions. When toggled, the bar plot would display the
                        top 8 genres that performed well in the given region. For example, Action
                        was the most successful in terms of NA_Sales in North America. Graph 3 was made with an input
                        text field. It aimed to find the best publisher for a given videogame genre.
                        This genre could be entered in a text field and submited via the button. The publishers were
                        summed over the Global_Sales for each of the videogames that they published in
                        that given genre.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        2. D3 was helpful in data binding to DOM elements in order to scale them correctly, and providing library methods to process data efficiently,
                        and offering neat accessories such as tooltips. 
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        3. However, there are a few reasons why I do not think it was the best tool. I do think that the documentaion was a bit scuffled due to different 
                        versions having quite a few modifications. Another issue that I ran into a lot was that the visualization methods (scaling, offsetting) were a bit
                        tedious and were not as smooth as other frameworks such as react. Lastly, I did find that a lot of the support community online (stackoverflow, etc.)
                        was not as helpful as other communities I have came across in other classes/work experience.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        4. Although the dashboard fits on my screen, I do believe that users who have a smaller screen or are using a phone/tablet will have a harder time
                        using/interpreting it. Due to my inexperience of javascript and bootstrap/css, I was not able to fit everything in flex boxes so that the page would be
                        entirely responsive. I also realized from the second reading that in order to improve the visibility and accessibility of the dashboard, I should lean towards more colorblind
                        friendly shades so that the data bars do not blend  with each other. Also adding legends or arrows may be helpful to indicate more closesly where data is pointing to.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        5. I was very stuck on the data processing stage, which really inhibited my ability to spend time on the accessibility to all audiences. I think that if I were to spend more time
                        on this project, I would aim to create a more variety of graphs with helpful tooltips that describe the data in more detail. However, my limited knowledge of javascript and html/css 
                        is an obstacle that I hope to overcome soon, because developing eye friendly data visualization tools is imperative to presenting work and statistics. I also would spend more time with
                        the colors and flex sizes of the graphs so that they could be responsive to users who have different devices and can change with the screen size.
                    </ul>
